# Intune Win32 Deployer
> Version 2022.22.0

Create and deploy winget and chocolatey (win32) apps to Intune with one click!

## Installation
To install just download the whole repository and execute the "INSTALL_Intune-Win32-Deployer.ps1" in the root folder. 
This will copy the program files to your local Appdata and creates a shortcut in the start menu. (no Desktop icon, cause I don't like those). 

In addition the installer asks you if you want to install winget and chocolatey (as an admin).
